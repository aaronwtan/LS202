<!-- Given the code below, what is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that
 the div needs to entirely contain the section element (including its margins)?
 How does this differ from the result of the previous practice problem? -->

 <!-- 

<div>
  <section>content</section>
</div>

div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

section {
  border: 4px solid red;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: block;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  width: 500px;
}

 -->

<div>
  <section>content</section>
</div>

<style>
  div {
    background-color: lightgray;
    border: 1px solid black;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    display: inline-block;
    height: 360;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    width: 580;
  }

  section {
    border: 4px solid red;
    box-sizing: content-box;
    display: block;
    height: 300px;
    margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    width: 500px;
  }
</style>

<!-- 
width: 580
height: 360
The same dimensions are still needs to contain the section element, but the difference
is that since the display property for the section element is now 
block instead of inline-block, if the div container dimensions were expanded,
additional elements would be placed on new lines. With inline-block, if there were
space on a line for additional elements, those elements would be placed horizontally
to fill the space before starting a new line.

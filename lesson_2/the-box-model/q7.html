<!-- Challenge. Given our solution to the previous question, 
 what will happen if we put the article tags on separate lines? -->

<section>
  <article>content</article>
  <article>more content</article>
</section>

<!-- 
Because there is now a line break between the two article elements,
the browser will actually compress this line break down to a single 
whitespace character and render it as its own box between the two
article elements. Since the two article elements were sized to fit precisely
within the section element, this extra box allocated to the whitespace
character is just enough to push the second article element to the next line.

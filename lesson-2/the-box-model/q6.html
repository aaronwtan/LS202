<!-- Will the following code display the two article boxes side by side?
 If not, why not? How would you fix it so that it places the boxes side by side? -->

<!-- 
The article boxes will not be placed side by side, but rather on two separate lines.
Article elements are block elements by default, which means they will each always occupy
a single line by themself.
Additionally, since no box-sizing value has been specified for the article selector, 
the default value is set to content-box. This means that the content area width for both
article elements before accounting for padding and borders will each be exactly 50%
of the section width, which would just be enough to place the article elements side
by side if there were no padding or borders. But since there is padding and borders,
this would cause the rendered width of both elements together to not fit on one line,
so the second article element would be placed on a new line.
To ensure both elements are placed side by side on the same line, the display property
can instead be set to inline-block and the box-sizing property can be set to border-box.

<!-- Given the following HTML, would <section>, <aside>, <article>, 
  or <div> be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as <sometag>? -->

<!-- 
  <sometag>
    <h3>Text-align Property</h3>
    <p>
      Given the width of the paragraph, the heading looks odd hanging out on
      the left side of the screen. Let's center it instead; we'll do this
      with the text-align property:
    <p>

    <pre>
      <h1 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Hello, Internet!</h1>
    </pre>
  </sometag> 
-->

<!-- <section> would be most appropriate because its not a standalone item
  but also appears to be part of a larger document and also includes a heading -->

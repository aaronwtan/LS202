  <h3>Hex Colors</h3>

  <p>
    Most graphics and design applications like Photoshop and Pixelmator
    display colors in hexadecimal format, so it's easy to copy and paste
    color values you need from one program into your editor as a CSS
    property.

      If you're unfamiliar with the hexadecimal numbering system, it uses 16
      different digits instead of the ten the decimal system uses. The hex
      digits are 0 through 9, as in the decimal system, but also include a
      through f (or A through F) as valid digits.
